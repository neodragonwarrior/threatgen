Threat Gen is a threat generator tool designed to assist with threat modeling activities. It provides a systematic way to document potential threats for applications or systems, enhancing security assessments through a structured approach to threat identification and reporting.

Features
Application Details Input: Capture essential information like application name, document owner, and reviewers.
DFD Integration: Upload and display a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to visually represent the system.
Threat Generation: Use the 5W (Who, When, What, Why, Where) method to describe and generate potential threats.
Severity Levels: Assign severity levels (High, Medium, Low) to each threat and apply dynamic color coding.
Mitigation and Resolution: Document mitigation steps and resolution status (Open, Closed).
Export Capability: Export the threat details in a structured format for reporting purposes.
Visual Representation: A circle chart displays the severity distribution of identified threats.
